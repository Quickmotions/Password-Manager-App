# Password Manager Application
The Python Password Manager is a program that securely stores all your login credentials and passwords for various websites and applications. It allows users to generate and save strong passwords for each website or application they use, so they don't have to remember multiple passwords.

# Functional Requirements

### Password Management:

- Users can add a new login entry, including the website name, URL, username, and password.
- Users can edit or delete an existing login entry.
- Users can search for a specific login entry by website name or username.
- Users can generate a strong password using a built-in password generator.

### Security:

- All user data should be encrypted and stored securely.
- The password manager should require a master password to access the user's data.
- The password manager should have some sort of password reset system

### User Interface:

- The password manager should have a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate.
- The user interface should display all the saved login entries in a clear and organized manner.
- The user interface should have options to add, edit, delete, and search for login entries.

# Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance:

- The password manager should be responsive and fast, even when dealing with a large number of login entries.

### Usability:

- The password manager should be easy to use and require minimal user training.

### Compatibility:

- The password manager should be compatible with different operating systems (Windows, Linux, and Mac).

### Security:

- The password manager should be designed with security in mind, and all user data should be stored securely and encrypted.

# Tools and Technologies:

- Python 3.x
- PyCrypto or cryptography module for encryption and decryption
- SQLite or any other database system for data storage
- Tkinter or PyQt for the graphical user interface
